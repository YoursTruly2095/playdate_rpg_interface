# playdate_rpg_interface

A basic crank-centric menu template for Playdate console RPGs. 

Based on ConfidentFloor6601/playdate_rpg_interface

Some configuration options are available 
1) Number of icons in the menu
2) Size of icons
3) Vertical location of the selection box
4) Angle through which to turn the crank to select next icon

This version includes placeholder graphics so it runs OTB in Love2d. 
You can use the graphics in your game if you want to. But you won't want to :-)
